### PANOSETI Description
PANOSETI is a novel optical and near-infrared (350 - 1650 nm) instrument designed to greatly enlarge the current Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) phase space. The Pulsed All-sky Near-infrared Optical SETI (PANOSETI) observatory will be a dedicated SETI facility that aims to increase sky area searched, wavelengths covered, number of stellar systems observed, and duration of time monitored. This observatory will offer an "all-observable-sky" optical and wide-field near-infrared pulsed technosignature and astrophysical transient search that is capable of surveying the entire northern hemisphere. The final implemented experiment will search for transient pulsed signals occurring between nanosecond to second time scales.

* High-time resolution Astronomy

### The PANOSETI experiment
Fast time resolutions (nano-seconds to seconds) have barely been explored and represents an observational limit with current ground and space-based facilities, especially since facilities are unable to represent large sky coverage with high duty cycles. Even with these limitations, new flavored transient sources are being found at shorter timescales (seconds), e.g., ASASSN-15lh. GRB afterglows can be observed for seconds to hours after the initial triggering event, but there have been no known observations that extend down to milli-seconds to seconds for rapid follow-up (hatched area). GRB 080319B, the brightest recorded GRB in 2008, resides above the y-axis at 10^(51) erg s-1. Stellar variability from cataclysmic variables, Cepheids, stellar ares are typically less than 1034 erg s-1. PANOSETI will be capable of exploring luminous transient and variable phenomena from nanoseconds to seconds (grey area).

### The PANOSETI instrument
This instrument is aimed to search for technosignatures by means of detecting nano- to second light pulses that could have been emitted, for instance, for the purpose of interstellar communications or energy transfer. We present an instrument conceptual design based upon an assembly of 198 refracting 0.5-m telescopes tessellating two geodesic domes. This design produces a regular layout of hexagonal collecting apertures that optimizes the instrument footprint, aperture diameter, instrument sensitivity and total field-of-view coverage. We also present the optical performance of some Fresnel lenses envisaged to develop a dedicated panoramic SETI (PANOSETI) observatory that will dramatically increase sky-area searched (pi steradians per dome), wavelength range covered, number of stellar systems observed, interstellar space examined and duration of time monitored with respect to previous optical and near-infrared technosignature finders.

### Innovative instrumentation
We will use multi-pixel photon counter (MPPC) detectors for optical (300 -850 nm) and near-infrared (850- 1650 nm) wavelengths. An MPPC is an array of independent Geiger-mode avalanche photodiodes (APD), whose outputs are summed to a single terminal; this single pixel exhibits excellent pulse-height resolution, since each sub-pixel generates either a fully saturated pulse or is dormant.
